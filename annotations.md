#Welcome to your Codio course
Welcome to your very first course in the Codio "Computing Curriculum" series of courses. 

We really hope you'll have fun learning about computing and especially how to code. You are encouraged to work with fellow students on this material. Writing code in the real world is actually a very collaborative process and so helping each other is normal and it is good.

You can navigate your way through this course using the buttons at the top.

#An extremely boring web page
Having said that coding is fun, we are going to start with the most boring example imaginable. Don't worry, it will quickly get more interesting.

We are going to use this show you around the Codio IDE (that's the application you're be using to write read this course and you'll be using to write all your code).

@annotation:tour IDE
#What's an IDE?
An IDE is the tool that developers use to manage their code. Take a look at the left hand side. You'll see a 'File Tree'. This contains all of the files that your code uses. It may look scary to start with but you'll ver soon get used to it.

Let's start off by opening up a file. We'll start off by opening up `index.html`, so go ahead and click on it. It will open up for you.

@annotation:tour indexhtml
#What is index.html?
The `index.html` file is the file that most web sites open up automatically. You can think of it as the home page. When you access your site, it is the file that will get displayed in your browser.

Now you've opened it up, you can see a familiar poem.

We'll explain this in a moment, but go to the next page and we'll see how it looks in your browser or your smartphone.

@annotation:tour preview
##Let's preview it now
So, let's now run this file in our preview window. At the top of the screen you can press the preview button ('Project Index').

You'll now see the world's most boring web page appear in your browser.

#Got a smartphone handy?
If you happend to have a smartphone to hand, you can run this boring web page on that, too. Go to the 'Project->QR Code Preview URL' menu option and a QR code will appear on screen. If you've got a QR code reader, you can now scan this in a view the page.

If you've not got one, just download a free one from your app store.

@annotation:tour change
#Change something
So feel free to go ahead and change some of the text. You can add a fourth verse if you like.

To preview it again, either press the Preview menu item, or press the refresh button if you've already got the preview window open.

#Making it look prettier
We said how boring it was. We'll try to make it marginally less boring now by at least making it look a little prettier.

##Get some new code
If you look at the menu bar, you'll see, next to the Preview button, a dropdown button with a rocket icon next to it. Click on the arrow to drop down the list and select `Prettier`.

This will change your code around. You'll notice you now have 2 files

```
index.html
main.css
```
Open them both up.
